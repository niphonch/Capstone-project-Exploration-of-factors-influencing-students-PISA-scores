#Exploration of Factors Influencing Students’ PISA Scores in Thailand with Machine Learning Approaches


### Problem Statement/Objectives

Students in Thailand continuously scored lower than the OECD average in reading, mathematics and science. 
1. What are the factors influencing student PISA scores in Thailand?
2. How can educational environment and systems be improved to support and raise student reading, mathematics, and science literacy skills in Thailand?

### Analysis

1. Import data and data preprocessing
    * Data cleaning
    * Dropping irrelevant coulumns
    * Removing and imputing null values
    * Removing outliers
    * Data engineering 
2. Feature selection: Numerical and Categorical variables
3. Model building
4. Model evaluation
5. Feature importance extraction


### Conclusion and recommendation

1. Explainable Boosting Machine models perform relatively well in predicting student’s PISA scores.
2. The most important factors in predicting student’s PISA scores in Thailand are : Student behavior hindering learning, Learning time (mins/week) - <science>, Discriminating school climate, Index of economic, social and cultural status, Total number of all teachers at school.
3. Factors most influencing PISA scores in high performing countries are mostly related to students’ ability, competency or performance.
4. School and family related factors have higher influence in PISA scores of low performing countries than high performing countries.
In order to improve student’s literacy in Thailand
1. Thailand can promote and support teaching approaches and strategies that enhance student deep learning and metacognition.
2. Thailand needs to improve school standards by strategically support schools budgets, resources especially human-resources.
